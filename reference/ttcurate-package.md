# ttcurate: What the Package Does

Helper functions and guidance for curating datasets for the
'TidyTuesday' weekly data project. 'TidyTuesday' is a project by the
'Data Science Learning Community' in which they post a weekly dataset in
a public data repository
(<https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday>) for people to analyze
and visualize. This package includes tools to explore past submissions,
analyze dataset sizes, and follow best practices for data preparation
and documentation.
